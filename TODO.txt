get tests running without rails, just including Test::Unit
get rdocs working properly
try it out with a real image

write functional tests (using actial Chunking::Image)
arrange tests to they can be run with various Detector variables e.g. axis



my notes
--------

Code is easier to test when it is accessible e.g.
  in class methods
  not hidden in if/else blocks
  in method calls instead of in the block body
