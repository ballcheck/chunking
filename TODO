use "__some_method" type methods for internal operations?

detector.rb
-----------

*class method version of detect_boundary
*usage examples
are max rgb values coupled to rmagick?
private methods untested

new features
------------
have colour_tolerance and non_colour_tolerance.
@axis could be a class, thus preventing passing strings / syms around.
method for traversing image - as_tree?
detect_all_boundaries
split_image method
recycle annotation mask on detect_nth_boundary, giving a full report of all runs.
image crop to coords
what should happen when detector bigger than image?

detect_colour_test.rb
---------------------
*finish test_should_annotate_correctly
quite a few tests want drying up

lib/image_traversal/image_traversal.rb
------------------------
this file just includes all the modules in the lib. find out convention.

test/unit/image_traversal/factories.rb
-------------------------------
build_run can only be called once per test because it stubs the 'new' method

lib/image_traversal/image/rmagick.rb
-----------------------------
whole module untested 
must be a method to do - get_pixel_colour

lib/image_traversal/image/base.rb
--------------------------
create colour / color aliases
aliases created here would refer to the template methods and raise.
draw_pixel_map! this require the base_image to be the same size as the pixel_map
new_from_pixel_map assumes 'new' method creates a new blank base_image from cols, rows

lib/image_traversal/boundary.rb
------------------------
whole thing untested

test/unit/image_traversal/pixel_is_colour_test.rb
------------------------------------------
*these test are fr Image::Base
all these nils seem suspicious.
test_equal_if_any_item_is_equal - redo using sequence

test/unit/image_traversal/behavioral/test_cases.rb
-------------------------------------------
surely you don't have to require the other files in the module...
test_should_work_with_image_path - not right place for test, not a good test either.

test/unit/image_traversal/behavioral/behavioral.rb
-------------------------------------------
run these tests again, swapping image library
behavioral tests for other methods e.g. nth_boundary
these tests are only really for detect_boundary.rb so should be reorganised.
cmyk? rgba?
remove these 2 lines from all over this file
        img = img.rotate( -90 ) if @axis == :y
        img = img.invert( @axis ) if invert?
test_fuzz not implemented

test/unit/image_traversal/detect_boundary_test.rb
------------------------------------------
be able to run these tests with various detector options
is this really needed everywhere?
  detector.stubs( :detect_colour? )
these tests (if/if not) could be combined
test_should_alias_colour_with_color - is it conclusive? is it needed?
